	<h1>Geographic information system</h1>

	<blockquote>
		<p>A geographic information system (GIS) is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage,
			and present all types of geographical data. The acronym GIS is sometimes used for geographical information
			science or geospatial information studies to refer to the academic discipline or career of working with
			geographic information systems and is a large domain within the broader academic discipline of
			Geoinformatics. In the simplest terms, GIS is the merging of cartography, statistical analysis, and computer
			science technology.
			<br>A GIS can be thought of as a system—it digitally makes and "manipulates" spatial areas that may be
			jurisdictional, purpose, or application-oriented. Generally, a GIS is custom-designed for an organization.
			Hence, a GIS developed for an application, jurisdiction, enterprise, or purpose may not be necessarily
			interoperable or compatible with a GIS that has been developed for some other application, jurisdiction,
			enterprise, or purpose. What goes beyond a GIS is a spatial data infrastructure, a concept that has no such
			restrictive boundaries.
			<br>In a general sense, the term describes any information system that integrates, stores, edits, analyzes,
			shares, and displays geographic information for informing decision making. GIS applications are tools that
			allow users to create interactive queries (user-created searches), analyze spatial information, edit data in
			maps, and present the results of all these operations. Geographic information science is the science
			underlying geographic concepts, applications, and systems.
			<br>The first known use of the term "Geographic Information System" was by Roger Tomlinson in the year 1968
			in his paper "A Geographic Information System for Regional Planning". Tomlinson is also acknowledged as the
			"father of GIS".

	<p>GIS is a relatively broad term that can refer to a number of different technologies, processes, and methods.
		It is attached to many operations and has many applications related to engineering, planning, management,
		transport/logistics, insurance, telecommunications, and business.
		For that reason, GIS and location intelligence applications can be the foundation for many location-enabled
		services that rely on analysis, visualization and dissemination of results for collaborative decision making.

	<h2 id="historyofdevelopment">History of development</h2>
	<p>One of the first applications of spatial analysis in epidemiology is the 1832 "Rapport sur la marche et les
		effets du choléra dans Paris et le département de la Seine". The French geographer Charles Picquet represented
		the 48 districts of the city of Paris by halftone color gradient according to the percentage of deaths by
		cholera per 1,000 inhabitants.</p>
	<p>In 1854 John Snow depicted a cholera outbreak in London using points to represent the locations of some
		individual cases, possibly the earliest use of a geographic methodology in epidemiology. His study of the
		distribution of cholera led to the source of the disease, a contaminated water pump (the Broad Street Pump,
		whose handle he disconnected, thus terminating the outbreak).</p>
	<p>While the basic elements of topography and theme existed previously in cartography, the John Snow map was unique,
		using cartographic methods not only to depict but also to analyze clusters of geographically dependent
		phenomena.</p>
	<p>The early 20th century saw the development of photozincography, which allowed maps to be split into layers, for
		example one layer for vegetation and another for water. This was particularly used for printing contours –
		drawing these was a labour intensive task but having them on a separate layer meant they could be worked on
		without the other layers to confuse the draughtsman. This work was originally drawn on glass plates but later
		plastic film was introduced, with the advantages of being lighter, using less storage space and being less
		brittle, among others. When all the layers were finished, they were combined into one image using a large
		process camera. Once color printing came in, the layers idea was also used for creating separate printing plates
		for each colour. While the use of layers much later became one of the main typical features of a contemporary
		GIS, the photographic process just described is not considered to be a GIS in itself – as the maps were just
		images with no database to link them to.</p>
	<p>Computer hardware development spurred by nuclear weapon research led to general-purpose computer "mapping"
		applications by the early 1960s.</p>
	<p>The year 1960 saw the development of the world's first true operational GIS in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada by the
		federal Department of Forestry and Rural Development. Developed by Dr. Roger Tomlinson, it was called the Canada
		Geographic Information System (CGIS) and was used to store, analyze, and manipulate data collected for the
		Canada Land Inventory – an effort to determine the land capability for rural Canada by mapping information about
		soils, agriculture, recreation, wildlife, waterfowl, forestry and land use at a scale of 1:50,000. A rating
		classification factor was also added to permit analysis.</p>
	<p>CGIS was an improvement over "computer mapping" applications as it provided capabilities for overlay,
		measurement, and digitizing/scanning. It supported a national coordinate system that spanned the continent,
		coded lines as arcs having a true embedded topology and it stored the attribute and locational information in
		separate files. As a result of this, Tomlinson has become known as the "father of GIS", particularly for his use
		of overlays in promoting the spatial analysis of convergent geographic data.</p>
	<p>CGIS lasted into the 1990s and built a large digital land resource database in Canada. It was developed as a
		mainframe-based system in support of federal and provincial resource planning and management. Its strength was
		continent-wide analysis of complex datasets. The CGIS was never available commercially.</p>
	<p>In 1964 Howard T. Fisher formed the Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis at the Harvard Graduate
		School of Design (LCGSA 1965–1991), where a number of important theoretical concepts in spatial data handling
		were developed, and which by the 1970s had distributed seminal software code and systems, such as SYMAP, GRID,
		and ODYSSEY – that served as sources for subsequent commercial development—to universities, research centers and
		corporations worldwide.</p>
	<p>By the early 1980s, M&S Computing (later Intergraph) along with Bentley Systems Incorporated for the CAD
		platform, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), CARIS (Computer Aided Resource Information System),
		MapInfo(MapInfo) and ERDAS (Earth Resource Data Analysis System) emerged as commercial vendors of GIS software,
		successfully incorporating many of the CGIS features, combining the first generation approach to separation of
		spatial and attribute information with a second generation approach to organizing attribute data into database
		structures. In parallel, the development of two public domain systems (MOSS and GRASS GIS) began in the late
		1970s and early 1980s.</p>
	<p>In 1986, Mapping Display and Analysis System (MIDAS), the first desktop GIS product emerged for the DOS operating
		system. This was renamed in 1990 to MapInfo for Windows when it was ported to the Microsoft Windows platform.
		This began the process of moving GIS from the research department into the business environment.</p>
	<p>By the end of the 20th century, the rapid growth in various systems had been consolidated and standardized on
		relatively few platforms and users were beginning to explore viewing GIS data over the Internet, requiring data
		format and transfer standards. More recently, a growing number of free, open-source GIS packages run on a range
		of operating systems and can be customized to perform specific tasks. Increasingly geospatial data and mapping
		applications are being made available via the world wide web.</p>
	<p>Several authoritative articles on the history of GIS have been published.</p>

	<h2 id="gistechniquesandtechnology">GIS techniques and technology</h2>
	<p>Modern GIS technologies use digital information, for which various digitized data creation methods are used. The
		most common method of data creation is digitization, where a hard copy map or survey plan is transferred into a
		digital medium through the use of a CAD program, and geo-referencing capabilities. With the wide availability of
		ortho-rectified imagery (both from satellite and aerial sources), heads-up digitizing is becoming the main
		avenue through which geographic data is extracted. Heads-up digitizing involves the tracing of geographic data
		directly on top of the aerial imagery instead of by the traditional method of tracing the geographic form on a
		separate digitizing tablet (heads-down digitizing).</p>

	<h2 id="relatinginfo">Relating information from different sources</h2>
	<p>GIS uses spatio-temporal (space-time) location as the key index variable for all other information. Just as a
		relational database containing text or numbers can relate many different tables using common key index
		variables, GIS can relate unrelated information by using location as the key index variable. The key is the
		location and/or extent in space-time.</p>
	<p>Any variable that can be located spatially, and increasingly also temporally, can be referenced using a GIS.
		Locations or extents in Earth space–time may be recorded as dates/times of occurrence, and x, y, and z
		coordinates representing, longitude, latitude, and elevation, respectively. These GIS coordinates may represent
		other quantified systems of temporo-spatial reference (for example, film frame number, stream gage station,
		highway mile-marker, surveyor benchmark, building address, street intersection, entrance gate, water depth
		sounding, POS or CAD drawing origin/units). Units applied to recorded temporal-spatial data can vary widely
		(even when using exactly the same data, see map projections), but all Earth-based spatial–temporal location and
		extent references should, ideally, be relatable to one another and ultimately to a "real" physical location or
		extent in space–time.</p>
	<p>Related by accurate spatial information, an incredible variety of real-world and projected past or future data
		can be analyzed, interpreted and represented to facilitate education and decision making. This key
		characteristic of GIS has begun to open new avenues of scientific inquiry into behaviors and patterns of
		previously considered unrelated real-world information.</p>

	<h2 id="gisuncertainties">GIS uncertainties</h2>
	<p>GIS accuracy depends upon source data, and how it is encoded to be data referenced. Land surveyors have been able
		to provide a high level of positional accuracy utilizing the GPS-derived positions. High-resolution digital
		terrain and aerial imagery, powerful computers and Web technology are changing the quality, utility, and
		expectations of GIS to serve society on a grand scale, but nevertheless there are other source data that have an
		impact on overall GIS accuracy like paper maps, though these may be of limited use in achieving the desired
		accuracy since the aging of maps affects their dimensional stability.</p>
	<p>In developing a digital topographic data base for a GIS, topographical maps are the main source of aerial
		photography and satellite images are extra sources for collecting data and identifying attributes which can be
		mapped in layers over a location facsimile of scale. The scale of a map and geographical rendering area
		representation type are very important aspects since the information content depends mainly on the scale set and
		resulting locatability of the map's representations. In order to digitize a map, the map has to be checked
		within theoretical dimensions, then scanned into a raster format, and resulting raster data has to be given a
		theoretical dimension by a rubber sheeting/warping technology process.</p>
	<p>A quantitative analysis of maps brings accuracy issues into focus. The electronic and other equipment used to
		make measurements for GIS is far more precise than the machines of conventional map analysis. All geographical
		data are inherently inaccurate, and these inaccuracies will propagate through GIS operations in ways that are
		difficult to predict.</p>

	<h2 id="datarepresentation">Data representation</h2>
	<p>GIS data represents real objects (such as roads, land use, elevation, trees, waterways, etc.) with digital data
		determining the mix. Real objects can be divided into two abstractions: discrete objects (e.g., a house) and
		continuous fields (such as rainfall amount, or elevations). Traditionally, there are two broad methods used to
		store data in a GIS for both kinds of abstractions mapping references: raster images and vector. Points, lines,
		and polygons are the stuff of mapped location attribute references. A new hybrid method of storing data is that
		of identifying point clouds, which combine three-dimensional points with RGB information at each point,
		returning a "3D color image". GIS thematic maps then are becoming more and more realistically visually
		descriptive of what they set out to show or determine.</p>

	<h2 id="datacapture">Data capture</h2>
	<p>Data capture—entering information into the system—consumes much of the time of GIS practitioners. There are a
		variety of methods used to enter data into a GIS where it is stored in a digital format.</p>
	<p>Existing data printed on paper or PET film maps can be digitized or scanned to produce digital data. A digitizer
		produces vector data as an operator traces points, lines, and polygon boundaries from a map. Scanning a map
		results in raster data that could be further processed to produce vector data.</p>
	<p>Survey data can be directly entered into a GIS from digital data collection systems on survey instruments using a
		technique called coordinate geometry (COGO). Positions from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) like
		Global Positioning System can also be collected and then imported into a GIS. A current trend in data collection
		gives users the ability to utilize field computers with the ability to edit live data using wireless connections
		or disconnected editing sessions. This has been enhanced by the availability of low-cost mapping-grade GPS units
		with decimeter accuracy in real time. This eliminates the need to post process, import, and update the data in
		the office after fieldwork has been collected. This includes the ability to incorporate positions collected
		using a laser rangefinder. New technologies also allow users to create maps as well as analysis directly in the
		field, making projects more efficient and mapping more accurate.</p>
	<p>Remotely sensed data also plays an important role in data collection and consist of sensors attached to a
		platform. Sensors include cameras, digital scanners and LIDAR, while platforms usually consist of aircraft and
		satellites. Recently with the development of Miniature UAVs, aerial data collection is becoming possible at much
		lower costs, and on a more frequent basis. For example, the Aeryon Scout was used to map a 50-acre area with a
		Ground sample distance of 1 inch (2.54 cm) in only 12 minutes.</p>
	<p>The majority of digital data currently comes from photo interpretation of aerial photographs. Soft-copy
		workstations are used to digitize features directly from stereo pairs of digital photographs. These systems
		allow data to be captured in two and three dimensions, with elevations measured directly from a stereo pair
		using principles of photogrammetry. Analog aerial photos must be scanned before being entered into a soft-copy
		system, for high-quality digital cameras this step is skipped.</p>
	<p>Satellite remote sensing provides another important source of spatial data. Here satellites use different sensor
		packages to passively measure the reflectance from parts of the electromagnetic spectrum or radio waves that
		were sent out from an active sensor such as radar. Remote sensing collects raster data that can be further
		processed using different bands to identify objects and classes of interest, such as land cover.</p>
	<p>When data is captured, the user should consider if the data should be captured with either a relative accuracy or
		absolute accuracy, since this could not only influence how information will be interpreted but also the cost of
		data capture.</p>
	<p>After entering data into a GIS, the data usually requires editing, to remove errors, or further processing. For
		vector data it must be made "topologically correct" before it can be used for some advanced analysis. For
		example, in a road network, lines must connect with nodes at an intersection. Errors such as undershoots and
		overshoots must also be removed. For scanned maps, blemishes on the source map may need to be removed from the
		resulting raster. For example, a fleck of dirt might connect two lines that should not be connected.</p>
