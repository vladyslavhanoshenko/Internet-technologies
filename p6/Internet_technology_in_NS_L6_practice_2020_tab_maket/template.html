				<p>The University of Montana (often simply referred to as the U; U of M, and UM) is a public research university
					located in Missoula, Montana, in the United States. Founded in 1893, the university is the flagship campus of the
					four-campus University of Montana System and is its largest institution. The main campus is located at the foot of
					Mount Sentinel, the mountain bearing Missoula's most recognizable landmark, a large hillside letter "M." It is a
					major source of research, continuing education, economic development and fine arts, as well as a driving force in
					strengthening Montana's ties with countries throughout the world.
					The university calls itself a "city within a city," and contains its own restaurants, medical facilities, banking,
					postal services, police department, and ZIP code. The University of Montana ranks 17th in the nation and fifth among
					public universities in producing Rhodes Scholars, with a total of 28 such scholars. The University of Montana has 11
					Truman Scholars, 14 Goldwater Scholars and 31 Udall Scholars to its name.
					The University of Montana's Maureen and Mike Mansfield Library houses the earliest authorized edition of the Lewis
					and Clark journals. Rolling Stone labelled the university the "most scenic campus in America" and Outside magazine
					called it "among the top 10 colleges nationally for combining academic quality and outdoor recreation".</p>

					<h2 id="history">History</h2>

					<p>An act of Congress of February 18, 1881 dedicated 72 sections (46,000 acres or 19,000 hectares) in Montana Territory
						for the creation of the University.
						Montana was admitted to the Union on November 8, 1889, and the Montana Legislature soon began to consider where the
						state's permanent capital and state university would be located. To be sure that the new state university would be
						located in Missoula, the city's leaders made an agreement with the standing capital of Helena that Missoula would
						stay out of the bidding for the new capital and would support Helena over its leading competitor, Anaconda. The
						cities' bids were supported by the rival Copper Kings, William A. Clark Marcus Daly, respectively.
						Missoula won the legislative vote for the new university at the Third Montana Legislative Assembly in February 1893.
						The University was formally opened in 1895. While plans for a university campus were progressing, classes were
						temporarily held at nearby Willard School. The South Missoula Land Company, owned by A.B. Hammond, Richard Eddy and
						Marcus Daly, joined with the Higgins family in donating land for the new campus. In June 1898 the cornerstone for
						A.J. Gibson designed University Hall was laid and Missoula became "the University City."</p>
